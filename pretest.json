      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Eg refers to the gap between valence and conduction bands, not between two conduction bands.",
        "b": "Correct. Eg is the minimum energy required to excite an electron into the conduction band.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Kinetic energy is not the same as bandgap energy.",

        "d": "Zero bandgap"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A flat curve means small curvature, leading to larger effective mass.",
        "b": "Correct. Effective mass m* = ℏ² / (d²E/dk²), so less curvature = larger m*.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Group velocity depends on slope, not curvature.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Bandgap is unrelated to curvature near the minimum."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This formula is not valid in semiconductors.",
        "b": "Correct. The effective mass formula is m* = ℏ² / (d²E/dk²).",
        "c": "Incorrect. E/k² does not define effective mass.",

        "d": "It becomes zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Larger curvature means smaller effective mass since m* ∝ 1/(d²E/dk²).",
        "b": "Incorrect. More curvature does not increase m*; it reduces it.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Effective mass varies with curvature, so it cannot remain constant.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Zero effective mass requires a linear E–k relation, which is not the case here."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Steeper slope means faster carriers, not slower.",
