      "question": "In an E–k diagram, a steeper slope indicates:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Lower group velocity",
        "b": "Higher group velocity",
        "c": "Constant group velocity",
        "d": "Zero group velocity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Lower slope corresponds to lower group velocity.",
        "b": "Correct. Group velocity is proportional to slope (dE/dk), so a steeper slope means higher velocity.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Group velocity is not constant; it varies with slope.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Zero slope corresponds to zero velocity, not a steeper slope."

      "question": "Which relation correctly defines the crystal momentum of an electron?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "p = m*v",
        "b": "p = ℏk",
        "c": "p = Eg/k",
        "d": "p = qE"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. p = m*v applies to classical free particles, not electrons in a crystal.",
        "b": "Correct. In semiconductor physics, crystal momentum is p = ℏk, where ℏ is the reduced Planck constant.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Eg/k has no relation to momentum.",
        "d": "Incorrect. qE gives force, not momentum."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Silicon has Eg ≈ 1.1 eV, which is lower than GaAs.",
        "b": "Correct. Gallium Arsenide has the highest bandgap ≈ 1.42 eV at room temperature.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Germanium has the lowest Eg ≈ 0.66 eV.",

        "d": "Zero effective mass"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Larger curvature corresponds to smaller effective mass, not larger.",
        "b": "Correct. Effective mass is inversely related to the curvature of E–k: m* = ℏ² / (d²E/dk²).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Effective mass varies with curvature.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Zero effective mass occurs only in linear dispersions like graphene, not here."

        "d": "The external electric field strength"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Group velocity depends on slope, not effective mass.",
        "b": "Correct. Effective mass is derived from curvature: m* = ℏ² / (d²E/dk²).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Bandgap affects allowed transitions, not directly m*.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Electric field modifies motion, not intrinsic effective mass."

      "question": "If the bandgap energy Eg of a material is 2 eV, what is the approximate frequency of a photon required to bridge this gap?",

        "d": "1.2 × 10^14 Hz"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This corresponds to a much lower photon energy than required.",
        "b": "Correct. Using E = hf → f = E/h, substituting Eg = 2 eV gives ≈ 7.3 × 10^14 Hz.",
        "c": "Incorrect. That frequency corresponds to a much higher photon energy.",

        "d": "5.2 × 10^-26 kg·m/s"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Using p = ℏk → 1.05×10^-34 × 2×10^9 = 2.1×10^-25 kg·m/s.",
        "b": "Incorrect. That value is too large; miscalculation of ℏk.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Off by a factor of 10.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Too small; incorrect substitution."

      "question": "If the conduction band curvature decreases, what happens to the mobility of electrons?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It increases",
        "b": "It decreases",
        "c": "It remains constant",
        "d": "It becomes infinite"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Less curvature → heavier effective mass → lower mobility.",
        "b": "Correct. Mobility μ ∝ 1/m*. Decreased curvature increases effective mass, reducing mobility.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Mobility depends on m*, so it changes here.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Infinite mobility would require zero effective mass, not reduced curvature."

        "c": "Less than 200 nm",
        "d": "Exactly 1550 nm"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Longer wavelengths correspond to lower photon energy, below Eg.",
        "b": "Correct. Using λ ≈ 1240/Eg ≈ 827 nm, which lies in the visible to near-infrared range.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Those correspond to far-UV photons with much higher energy than needed.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 1550 nm corresponds to ≈0.8 eV, insufficient for Eg = 1.5 eV."
