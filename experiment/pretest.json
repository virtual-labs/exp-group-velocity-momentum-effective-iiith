      "question": "1. In an E–k diagram, the slope of the energy vs. wavevector curve represents:",
      "options": {
        "a": "Momentum",
        "b": "Group velocity",
        "c": "Effective mass",
        "d": "Bandgap energy"
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The slope of the E–k diagram (dE/dk) gives the group velocity, which indicates how quickly an electron wave packet propagates in the crystal."
    },
    {
      "question": "2. Which physical quantity is directly proportional to the wavevector k in semiconductors?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Group velocity",
        "b": "Momentum",
        "c": "Effective mass",
        "d": "Bandgap energy"
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Crystal momentum is given by p = ℏk, meaning momentum is directly proportional to the wavevector."
    },
    {
      "question": "3. In a semiconductor, the bandgap energy (Eg) refers to:",
      "options": {
        "a": "The energy difference between two conduction bands",
        "b": "The energy required to move an electron from the valence band to the conduction band",
        "c": "The kinetic energy of free electrons",
        "d": "The energy stored in the lattice vibrations"
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The bandgap energy Eg is the minimum energy needed for an electron to jump from the valence band to the conduction band."

    {
      "question": "4. A flatter E–k curve around the conduction band minimum indicates:",
      "options": {
        "a": "Smaller effective mass",
        "b": "Larger effective mass",
        "c": "Higher group velocity",
        "d": "Zero bandgap"
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Effective mass is inversely proportional to the curvature of the E–k diagram. A flatter curve means less curvature, leading to a larger effective mass."
    },
    {
      "question": "5. Which relation connects effective mass (m*) with the curvature of the E–k diagram?",
      "options": {
        "a": "m* = ℏk / E",
        "b": "m* = ℏ² / (d²E/dk²)",
        "c": "m* = E / k²",
        "d": "m* = Eg / ℏk"
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The effective mass is calculated as m* = ℏ² / (d²E/dk²), meaning it depends on the curvature of the E–k graph."
    },
    {
      "question": "6. Among Si, GaAs, and Ge, which has the smallest bandgap energy at room temperature?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Silicon (Si)",
        "b": "Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)",
        "c": "Germanium (Ge)",
        "d": "All have the same Eg"
      },
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Germanium has the smallest bandgap (~0.66 eV), Silicon is ~1.1 eV, and GaAs has ~1.42 eV at room temperature."

    {
      "question": "7. If the curvature of the conduction band increases, what happens to the effective mass?",
      "options": {
        "a": "It decreases",
        "b": "It increases",
        "c": "It remains constant",
        "d": "It becomes zero"
      },
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Since m* ∝ 1/(d²E/dk²), a larger curvature leads to a smaller effective mass."
    },
    {
      "question": "8. For a semiconductor with Eg = 1.2 eV, what is the approximate photon wavelength corresponding to this bandgap?",
      "options": {
        "a": "1033 nm",
        "b": "689 nm",
        "c": "450 nm",
        "d": "300 nm"
      },
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Using λ ≈ 1240/Eg, we get λ ≈ 1240/1.2 ≈ 1033 nm, which lies in the infrared region."

    {
      "question": "9. What happens to group velocity when the E–k curve becomes very steep near the conduction band edge?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Group velocity decreases",
        "b": "Group velocity increases",
        "c": "Group velocity becomes zero",
        "d": "Group velocity becomes negative"
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Group velocity is proportional to dE/dk. A steeper slope means a higher derivative, hence a larger group velocity."
